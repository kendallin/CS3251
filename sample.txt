Listed is our attempts at debugging placing the vectors into the rtt array for
the class.
THis is a SENDERS terminal. Here we see the local host address printed at the top.
Next all packet sends are clarified and stated. A Keep alive packet is sent to a neighbor
and then the sender starts to listen.
and shortly after one is received from the senders poc.

Once the timeout has happened the ringo announces its done waiting and it sends an
RTT packet with its info out. It is received (no reported errors) by both of its
neighbors.

The sender than listens again and this is where the issue arrises. An RTT is received
by the sender and it begins to decompose it. I printed out the byte by byte values
that are returned for the address as well as the inputs for its function, this is
a valid loopback address (this fails on the virtual machines as well) and the method
collapses with a null pointer. This happens everytime you try to place an RTT with
every receipt of one.

Below is the receivers output. A lot of it is similar with the difference of
going to listening first. The final two "listenings" are the two different styles.
one for a timed listen, the other for a long one. The same issue persists with
not being able to read in the address.
