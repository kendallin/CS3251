THis is a SENDERS terminal. Here we see the local host address printed at the top.
It sends a packet to its POC then it begins to listen.

Once the timeout has happened the ringo announces its done waiting and it sends an
RTT packet with its info out. It is received (no reported errors) by both of its
neighbors.

After another timeout it sends out its RTT vector than waits to receive it. It receives a -1 from its POC because the 
POC was hit by the sender, and was not able to time responses so it does not know its timing. It then begins to send out data.

Story generation is when the file is being read and then it sends out the packets bit by bit.

We do see that the second packet fails which is a bug.

Below is the receivers output. A lot of it is similar with the difference of
going to listening first. It all works the same as the sneder up until it begins receiving the packets and printing them out. The second missing
packet can be see when it starts to errantly send a packet.

night, well, many of them actually- as I sat there, working on this assignment. I routinely checked the clock.
Was I imaging some deadline would end my suffering? It was only Tuesday and the project wasn't due until Wednesday night. No no, I knew
my release would not come at the stroke of a clock hand. I was simply checking the time to maintain my sanity.

I take a deep puff of my cigarette, smoke fills the public study space of Klaus. My fellow students around me cough, looking at me annoyed.

I don't notice them. 

I looked at my phone at a strand of texts that were popping up. I coldly put my phone down. I had just found out my wife was leaving me for 
a european man named Guisseppe that she met on a vespa tour of the alps. This news was nothing compared to the mountain of emotions I was feeling
at working on this assignment.

I take another strong pull on my cigarette, and almost simultaneous sip from my glass of whisky. 

"Are you ok?" A disturbed student calls out, inches from my face while still feeling like a mile away. It was then that I notice the tears streaming down my face.

"Why won't it work?" 

Wordlessly, the kind student places their hand on my shoulders.
