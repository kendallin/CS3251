Networking -- The Story of Sadness

It was a cold dreary night, well, many of them actually- as I sat there, working on this assignment. I routinely checked the clock.
Was I imaging some deadline would end my suffering? It was only Tuesday and the project wasn't due until Wednesday night. No no, I knew
my release would not come at the stroke of a clock hand. I was simply checking the time to maintain my sanity.

I take a deep puff of my cigarette, smoke fills the public study space of Klaus. My fellow students around me cough, looking at me annoyed.

I don't notice them. 

I looked at my phone at a strand of texts that were popping up. I coldly put my phone down. I had just found out my wife was leaving me for 
a european man named Guisseppe that she met on a vespa tour of the alps. This news was nothing compared to the mountain of emotions I was feeling
at working on this assignment.

I take another strong pull on my cigarette, and almost simultaneous sip from my glass of whisky. 

"Are you ok?" A disturbed student calls out, inches from my face while still feeling like a mile away. It was then that I notice the tears streaming down my face.

"Why won't it work?" 

Wordlessly, the kind student places their hand on my shoulders.
